INTRODUCTORY CHAPTERS</span></h2>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER I.<br />
THE PURPOSE OF THIS BOOK</h2>

<p>This book is written for the purpose of
giving our clients some ideas of the fundamental
principles that guide us when we select
stocks for them to buy, but these principles
are valuable to every person who trades
in listed stocks or in any other kind of speculative
stocks.</p>

<p>First of all, we want you to get a clear
conception of the meaning of the word speculation,
which is explained in the next chapter.
Our purpose is to protect you against
losses as well as to enable you to make profits,
and it is very important that you understand
how to provide for safety in your speculating.</p>

<p>It is a well known fact that there are tremendous
losses in stock speculation, but we
claim that almost all of these losses would
be avoided if all speculators were guided by
the principles expounded in this book.</p>

<p>"What" and "When" are two very important
words in stock speculation, and we cannot
urge upon you too strongly to study carefully
<a href="#CHAPTER_V">Chapters V. to IX.</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span></p>

<p><a href="#CHAPTER_X">Chapters X. to XV.</a> tell you much about
the influences that affect the prices of stocks,
a knowledge of which should also be a guide
to you in making your selections.</p>

<p>Perhaps the most important chapter in
the entire book is <a href="#CHAPTER_XXV">XXV.</a>, on Market Information.
A careful reading of this chapter
should convince you that much of the prevailing
information about the stock market
is misleading. That fact alone accounts for
many of the losses in stock speculation.</p>

<p>It has been our aim to state all facts
briefly. The entire book is not long, and it
will not require much of your time to read
it through carefully. We are sure you will
get many ideas from it that will help you.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER II.<br />
WHAT IS SPECULATION?</h2>

<p>To speculate is to theorize about something
that is uncertain. We can speculate
about anything that is uncertain, but we
use the word "speculation" in this book with
particular reference to the buying and selling
of stocks and bonds for the purpose of making
a profit. When people buy stocks and
bonds for the income they get from them
and the amount of that income is fixed, they
are said to invest and not to speculate. In
nearly all investments there is also an element
of speculation, because the market price
of investments is subject to change. "Investment"
also conveys the idea of holding
for some time whatever you have purchased,
while speculation conveys the idea of selling
for a quick profit rather than holding for
income.</p>

<p>To the minds of most people, the word
"speculation" conveys the thought of risk,
and many people think it means great risk.
The dictionary gives for one of the meanings
of speculation, "a risky investment for large<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
profit," but speculation need not necessarily
be risky at all. The author of this book once
used the expression, "stock speculating with
safety," and he was severely criticized by a
certain financial magazine. Evidently the
editor of that magazine thought that "speculating"
and "safety" were contradictory
terms, but the expression is perfectly correct.
Stock speculating with safety is possible.</p>

<p>Of course, we all know that the word
"safety" is seldom used in an absolute sense.
We frequently read such expressions as:
"The elevators in modern office buildings are
run with safety." "It is possible to cross
the ocean with safety." "You can travel
from New York to San Francisco in a railroad
train with safety." And yet accidents
do occur and people do lose their lives in
elevators, steamships, and railroad trains.
Because serious accidents are comparatively
rare, we use the word "safety."</p>

<p>In like manner it is possible to purchase
stocks sometimes when it is almost certain
that the purchaser will make a profit, and
that is "stock speculating with safety." When
Liberty Bonds were selling in the 80's, many
people bought them for speculation. They<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
were not taking any risk, except the slight
risk that the market price might go still
lower before it would go higher, and that
did not involve any risk for those who knew
they could hold them. The fact that the
market prices of Liberty Bonds would advance
was based upon an economic law that
never fails. That law is that when interest
rates go up, the market prices of bonds go
down, and when interest rates go down, the
market prices of bonds go up. When Liberty
Bonds were selling in the 80's, interest rates
were so very high, it was certain that they
would come down. That the market prices
of Liberty Bonds would go up was also certain,
but nobody could tell how much they
would go up in a given time. It was that
element of uncertainty that made them speculative,
and not that there was any doubt
about the fact that the market prices of
them would go up. Buying Liberty Bonds
at that time was speculating with safety.
If you read this book with understanding,
you will know much about speculating with
safety.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER III.<br />
SOME TERMS EXPLAINED</h2>

<p>There are certain terms used in connection
with stock speculation that are very familiar
to those who come in contact with
stock brokers, and yet are not always familiar
to those who do business by mail. Undoubtedly
the majority of our readers are
familiar with these terms, but we give these
definitions for the benefit of the few who
are not familiar with them.</p>

<p>Trader: A person who buys and sells
stocks is usually referred to as a trader. The
word probably originated when it was customary
to trade one stock for another and
later was used to refer to a person who sold
one stock and bought another. He was a
trader; but the person who buys stocks for
a profit and sells them and takes his profit
when he gets an opportunity, may not be a
trader in the strict sense of the word. However,
for convenience, we use the word
"trader" in this book to refer to any one who
buys or sells stocks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p>Speculator: This word refers to a person
who buys stocks for profit, with the expectation
of selling at a higher price, without
reference to the earnings of the stock. He
may sell first, with the expectation of buying
at a lower price, as explained in <a href="#CHAPTER_XVII">Chapter
XVII.</a> on "Short Selling." In many cases
where we use the word "trader," it would
be more correct to use the word "speculator."</p>

<p>Investor: An investor differs from a speculator
in the fact that he buys stocks or
bonds with the expectation of holding them
for some time for the income to be derived
from them, without reference to their speculative
possibilities. We believe that investors
always should give some consideration to
the speculative possibilities of their purchases.
It frequently is possible to get speculative
profits without increase of risk or
loss of income.</p>

<p>Bull: One who believes that the market
price of stocks will advance is called a bull.
Of course, it is possible to be a bull in one
stock and a bear in another. The word is
used very frequently with reference to the
market, a bull market meaning a rising
market.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>Bear: The opposite of a bull is a bear.
It refers to a person who believes that the
market value of stocks will decline, and a
bear market is a declining market.</p>

<p>Lambs: "Lambs" refers to that part of
the public that knows so little about stock
speculating that they lose all their money
sooner or later. The bulls and bears get
them going and coming. If the lambs would
read this book carefully, they would discover
reasons why they lose their money.</p>

<p>Long and Short: Those who <b>own</b> stocks
are said to be long, and those who <b>owe</b> stocks
are said to be short. Short selling is explained
in <a href="#CHAPTER_XVII">Chapter XVII</a>.</p>

<p>Odd Lot: Stocks on exchanges are sold
in certain lots. On the New York Stock Exchange,
100 shares is a lot; and on the Consolidated
Stock Exchange, 10 shares is a lot.
Less than these amounts is an odd lot. When
you sell an odd lot you usually get <span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">8</span> less
than the market price; and when you buy an
odd lot, you usually pay <span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">8</span> more than the
market price; that is, <span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">8</span> of a dollar on each
share where prices are quoted in dollars.</p>

<p>Point: It is a common expression to say
that a stock went up or down a point, which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
means a dollar in a stock that is quoted in
dollars, but a cent in a stock that is quoted in
cents, as many of the stocks are on the New
York Curb. In cotton quotations, a point is
<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">100</span> part of a cent. For instance, if cotton
is quoted at 18.12, it means 18 cents and
<span class="abv">12</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">100</span> of a cent per pound, and if it went
up 30 points the quotation would be 18.42.</p>

<p>Reaction: Every person who has traded
in listed stocks probably is familiar with this
word. It means to act in an opposite direction,
but it is used especially to refer to a
decline in the price of a stock that has been
going up.</p>

<p>Rally: "Rally" is the opposite of the sense
in which "reaction" usually is used. When
a stock is going down and it turns and goes
up, it is called a rally.</p>

<p>Commitment: This term is used referring
to a purchase of stock. It is more commonly
used by investment bankers when they
contract to buy an issue, but the term sometimes
is used by traders.</p>

<p>Floating Supply: The stock of a company
that is in the hands of that part of the public
who is likely to sell, is referred to as floating
supply.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IV.<br />
A CORRECT BASIS FOR SPECULATING</h2>

<p>We maintain that there is only one basis
upon which successful speculation can be carried
on continually; that is, never to buy a
security unless it is selling at a price below
that which is warranted by assets, earning
power, and prospective future earning power.</p>

<p>There are many influences that affect the
movements of stock prices, which are referred
to in subsequent chapters. All of these
should be studied and understood, but they
should be used as secondary factors in relation
to the value of the stock in which you
are trading.</p>

<p>If the market price of any stock is far below
its intrinsic value and there is no reason
why the future should bring about a change
in this value that will decrease it, then you
may be certain that important influences are
working against the market price of the stock
for the time being. In the course of time the
market price will go up towards the real
value. This matter will be more fully explained
in subsequent chapters.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>You always should keep in mind the fact
that when you buy a stock at a higher price
than its intrinsic value, you are taking a
risk. The stock may have great future possibilities,
but it is risky to buy stocks when
present assets and earnings do not warrant
their market prices, no matter how attractive
prospective future earnings may appear.
However, the possibilities of profit sometimes
are so great that one is justified in taking
this risk.</p>

<p>It is our belief that the majority of traders
buy stocks because they are active in the
market and somebody said they were a good
buy, even though the real values may not
be nearly as much as the market prices.</p>

<p>As an example of this kind of trading, we
want to call your attention to a news item
that appeared in a New York paper. It stated
that on April 1st, some brokers in Detroit,
as an April Fool joke, gave out a tip to buy
A. F. P., meaning April Fool Preferred, but
when asked what it meant, replied "American
Fire Protection." Of course, there was
no such stock, but there was active trading
in it until the joke was discovered. Evidently
it is not necessary to list a stock on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
the Detroit Stock Exchange in order to trade
in it.</p>

<p>This story may or may not be true, but
we believe the statement that people trade
in stocks they do not know anything about
is true. You should be careful not to buy
a stock merely because somebody says it
is a good thing to buy, unless the person
making the statement is in the business of
giving information on stocks, because it may
be only a rumor with no substantial basis.
Of course, if many people act on the rumor,
there will be active trading in the stock, and
it is frequently for that purpose that such
rumors are started.</p>

<h2><span class="p3"><i>PART TWO</i><br />
WHAT and WHEN TO BUY and SELL</span></h2>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a>CHAPTER V.<br />
WHAT STOCKS TO BUY</h2>

<p>In deciding what stocks to buy, it is well
to consider first the classes of stocks, and
then what particular stocks you should buy
in the classes you select. We would first of
all divide all stocks into two classes, those
listed on the New York Stock Exchange and
those not listed on the New York Stock Exchange.
As a rule, it is better to buy stocks
listed on the New York Stock Exchange, although
there are frequent exceptions to this
rule.</p>

<p>Then, the stocks listed on the New York
Stock Exchange may be divided into classes,
such as railroad stocks, public utility stocks,
motor stocks, tire stocks, oil stocks, copper
stocks, gold stocks, and so forth. At certain
times certain stocks are in a much more favorable
condition than at other times. In
1919, when the industrial stocks were selling
at a very high price, the public utility stocks
and gold stocks were selling low, because it
was impossible to increase incomes in proportion
to the increase in operating costs.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
But since the beginning of 1921, the condition
of these two classes of stocks has been
improving and the market has reflected that
improvement.</p>

<p>At the time of this writing (early in April,
1922) we are recommending the stocks of
only a very few manufacturing companies;
but we are recommending a number (not all)
of the railroad and public utility stocks, and
a few specially selected stocks among the
other classes.</p>

<p>In every instance, when you make a selection,
you should consider the company's assets,
present earnings, and prospective future
earnings, and then take into consideration
all the influences that affect price movements,
as explained in subsequent chapters.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER VI.<br />
WHAT STOCKS NOT TO BUY</h2>

<p>A great deal more can be said about stocks
you should not buy than about stocks you
should buy, because the list is very much
larger.</p>

<p>Stocks not listed on the New York Stock
Exchange, as a rule, should not be bought
by a careful speculator, but as stated in the
previous chapter, there are exceptions to that
rule. Billions of dollars have been lost in
the past by buying stocks that have become
worthless. A few years ago a list of defunct
securities was compiled, and it took
two large volumes in which to enumerate
them. New ones have been added to them
every year. Therefore, it is very important
that you should give careful thought to the
subject of what stocks <b>not</b> to buy.</p>

<p>Nearly all promotion stocks (stocks in new
companies) are a failure. An extremely
small percentage of them are very successful,
and the successful ones are referred to
in the advertising of the new ones; but, on
the basis of average, the chances are you will<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
lose your money entirely in promotion stocks.
We believe that most of the promotion companies
are started in perfectly good faith,
although some of them are swindles from the
beginning; but no matter how honest and
well meaning the organizers are, the chances
of success are against them. Therefore, we
say that promotion stocks should not be
bought by the ordinary man who is looking
for a good speculation, because his chances
of making a large profit with a minimum
risk are very much better when he buys
stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange
and uses good judgment in doing so.</p>

<p>Among the listed stocks there are many
you should not buy. First of all, eliminate
them by classes. Do not buy the classes of
stocks that are selling too high now. You
may say that there are some exceptions in
all classes. That may or may not be so, but
in any event, you have a better chance of
profiting by confining most of your purchases
to the classes of stocks that are in the most
favorable position.</p>

<p>As a rule, when stocks are first listed, they
sell much higher than they do a short time
afterwards. Of course, that is not always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
true. It is more likely to be true when a
stock is listed during a very active market,
when prices are more easily influenced by
publicity. The high price of it is usually
due to the fact that publicity is given to it,
and as soon as the effect of this publicity
wears off, the market price of the stock declines.</p>

<p>It is a good rule never to buy stocks that
brokers urge you to buy. Your own common
sense ought to tell you that a stock that is
advertised extensively by brokers is likely
to sell up in price while the advertising is
going on and will drop in price just as soon
as the advertising stops.</p>

<p>Many people notice that and they think
they can profit by buying when the advertising
starts and sell out when they get a good
profit, but the majority of them lose money.
The stock may not respond to the advertising,
or if it does go up, they may wait too long
before selling. Those who do sell and
make 200% or 300% profit in a very short
time are almost sure to lose it all in an effort
to repeat the transaction. Many of those
who read this know it is true from their own
experience.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>You should leave such stocks strictly alone.
You may win once or twice, but you are sure
to lose if you keep it up. As a rule stocks
of this kind have very little value and the
brokers who boost them make their own
money from the losses of their foolish followers.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.<br />
WHEN TO BUY STOCKS</h2>

<p>Stocks should be bought when they are
cheap. By being cheap, we mean that the
market price is much less than the intrinsic
value. In <a href="#CHAPTER_X">Chapters X. to XV.</a> we talk about
influences that affect the price movements
of stocks. By studying these carefully you
should be able to decide when stocks generally
are cheap. Of course, not all stocks
are cheap at the same time, but the majority
of listed stocks do go up and down at the
same time, as a rule.</p>

<p>At the time of this writing (in the early
part of April, 1922) there are a great many
stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange
that are selling at prices much less
than their intrinsic values, but there are some
stocks that should not be bought now, nor
at any other time. There are some stocks
listed on the New York Stock Exchange now
that perhaps have no intrinsic value and
never will have any. Nevertheless we consider<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
that right now<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> is one of the times for
buying stocks. There are unusual bargains
to be had, although keen discrimination is
necessary in order to be able to pick out the
bargains.</p>

<p>As a usual thing, it is a good time to buy
stocks when nearly everybody wants to sell
them. When general business conditions are
bad, trading on the stock exchanges very
light, and everybody you meet appears to be
pessimistic, then we advise you to look for
bargains in stocks. The last six months of
1921 was an unusually good time for buying
stocks.</p>

<p>It is well known that the large interests
accumulate stocks at such times. They buy
only when the stocks are offered at a low
price and try not to buy enough at any one
time to give an appearance of activity in
the market, but they buy continually when
the market is very dull. It seems to be characteristic
of human nature to think that business
conditions are going to continue just
as they are. When business is bad, nearly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
everybody thinks business will be bad for a
long time, and when business is good, nearly
everybody thinks business will be good almost
indefinitely. As a matter of fact, conditions
are always changing. It never is possible
for either extremely good times nor for
extremely bad times to continue indefinitely.</p>

<p>You can buy stocks cheaper when there is
very little demand for them, and you should
arrange your affairs so as to be prepared to
buy at such times.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.<br />
WHEN NOT TO BUY STOCKS</h2>

<p>There are times when stocks should not
be bought, and that is when nearly all stocks
have advanced beyond their real values. It
is doubtful if there ever is a time when all
stocks have advanced beyond their real values,
but when the great majority of stocks
have so advanced, there is likely to be a general
decline in all stock prices. The stocks
that are not selling too high will decline some
in sympathy with the others. Therefore,
there are times when we advise our clients
not to buy any stocks.</p>

<p>Some organizations giving advice in regard
to the buying of stocks, advise their clients
to refrain entirely from buying for periods
of a year or longer, but we think it is seldom
advisable to refrain entirely from buying for
any great length of time. There usually are
some good opportunities if you watch carefully
for them. It is our business to watch
for these opportunities and tell our clients
about them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>There are also times when the technical
condition of the market is such that we advise
our clients to refrain from buying for
a while. See <a href="#CHAPTER_XIV">Chapter XIV</a>.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER IX.<br />
WHEN TO SELL STOCKS</h2>

<p>You should sell stocks when the market
price is too high. That is a general rule, but
it is necessary for you to study all the influences
affecting stock prices to be able to
decide more accurately when you should sell
your stocks. We give you, in future chapters,
much more information on judging the
markets.</p>

<p>Another general rule, is to sell stocks when
nearly everybody is buying them. It is a
well known fact that the great majority of
people buy stocks near the top and sell near
the bottom. Naturally when everybody is
optimistic, stocks will sell up high, but sooner
or later they will come down again, and when
everything looks very promising is a good
time to sell. It is better to lose a little of the
profit that you might have made by holding
on longer than not to be on the safe side.
The man who tries to sell at the top nearly
always loses, because stocks seldom sell as
high as it is predicted they will, or, in other<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
words, the prediction of higher prices is advanced
more rapidly than the prices.</p>

<p>We remember reading in 1916, when U. S.
Steel sold up around $136 a share, a prediction
that it was going to sell up to $1000 a
share. Probably many people who read such
news items consider them seriously. Of
course, that was a most exaggerated prediction,
but during the extreme activity of a
bull market, it seems that nearly everybody
is talking in exaggerated terms of optimism.
That is why most traders seldom ever take
their profits in a bull market. They wait
until stock prices start to come down, and
then they are likely to think there will be
rallies, and keep on waiting until they lose
all their profits.</p>

<p>On the other hand, some people make the
mistake of selling too soon. Just because
your purchase shows a liberal profit is no
reason why you should sell. The stock may
have been very cheap when you bought it.
In 1920, Peoples Gas sold below $30. Those
who bought it then were able to double their
money by the close of 1921, and many sold
out and took their profits. Of course, if they
invested the proceeds in other stocks that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
were just starting upward, they may not
have lost anything, but there was no particular
reason for selling Peoples Gas at that
time. The public utilities generally were
coming into their own, and nearly all of them
were regarded by economic students as having
unusual opportunities for profit.</p>

<p>Then again, it is not always a mistake to
sell a stock in order to get funds to put into
something else that seems more promising,
even though the stock you sell is likely to
go much higher.</p>

<p>It is very important that you should try
to sell your stocks at the right time. That
is the main thing to keep in mind and it is
better to sell too soon than too late. Don't
be too greedy and hold on for a big profit.

INFLUENCES AFFECTING STOCK PRICES</span></h2>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.<br />
MOVEMENTS IN STOCK PRICES</h2>

<p>It is due to the fact that stock prices constantly
move up or down that speculation is
possible. Sometimes certain stocks remain
almost at a standstill for a long period of
time, but at least a part of the stocks listed
on the Exchanges move either up or down.
If one always could tell just what way they
were going to move, it would be comparatively
easy to make a fortune within a short
time.</p>

<p>In the last twenty years, a great deal of
time and money has been spent by statistical
organizations in checking up statistics for
the purpose of ascertaining a definite basis
upon which to predict future movements in
stock prices. Several of these organizations
use very different statistics upon which to
base their conclusions, and yet their conclusions
are very similar. They have proved
beyond any question of doubt that some of
these movements are clearly indicated by
laws that never fail.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span></p>

<p>We do not attempt in this book to explain
the fundamental statistics upon which the
predictions of business cycles are based, but
in the next five chapters we explain some
of the influences that affect the movements
in stock prices. Read these chapters very
carefully, for your success in stock speculation
will depend very largely upon your
correct prediction of these movements.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XI.<br />
MAJOR MOVEMENTS IN PRICES</h2>

<p>Stock prices move up and down in cycles.
These are the major movements in prices,
but there may be many minor movements up
and down within the major movements. These
stock price movements nearly always precede
a change in business conditions; that
is, an upward movement in stock prices is
an indication that business conditions are
going to improve, and a downward movement
in stock prices is an indication that
business conditions are going to get worse.</p>

<p>At the present writing, we are in a period
of improvement. Stock prices began to go
up in August, 1921. The upward movement
has been slow, but gradual. In a period of
seven months, forty representative stocks
show an upward movement of about 20
points, although business has not shown
much improvement. A steady upward movement
in stock prices is a sure sign that business
conditions are beginning to improve,
even though that improvement is not
noticeable.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>These major stock movements are not an
exact duplicate of any previous ones, and it
is impossible to tell how long they will last
or just what course they will take. Certain
influences could change a period of improvement
into a period of prosperity very quickly.</p>

<p>A period of prosperity is noted for high
prices, high wages, and increasing production
in all lines. Everybody is optimistic.
Most people spend their money freely, and
that makes times better. As prices go up
and business increases, more money is required
in business and interest rates go up.
As a consequence, when interest rates go up,
bond prices go down. During this period,
speculative stocks are selling at their highest
prices; and under the influence of this movement,
many stocks that have no actual value
sell up at high prices. Of course, wise speculators
sell all their stocks during this period.</p>

<p>Following a period of prosperity comes a
period of decline. The first sign of it usually
is a severe break in the stock market. At
that time general business is running along
at top speed and there is no sign of a let-up,
but this break in the stock market should
be a warning. Most people think the break<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
is merely a temporary reaction&mdash;they may
refer to it as a HEALTHY reaction&mdash;and
they start buying stocks again, and put the
market up, but it does not go up as high as
it was before the break occurred. When
stock prices do not rally beyond the prices
at which they were before the break occurred,
it is a sign that the turning point has been
reached and that the bear market has started,
although the majority of people do not realize
this until a long time afterwards.</p>

<p>Next comes a period of depression, when
we have low prices, low wages, hard times,
tight money, and many commercial failures.
Many people who lost all their money during
the speculation period, become thrifty
and economize during the period of depression,
and start in to save again. Nearly
everybody is pessimistic during this period.
Trading on the Stock Exchange is irregular
and as a rule very light.</p>

<p>This is the time to get stock bargains,
but the general public as a rule doesn't take
advantage of it. People are scared and think
prices will go still lower. The big interests
accumulate stocks during this period, and
sell them during the period of prosperity.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XII.<br />
THE MONEY MARKET AND STOCK PRICES</h2>

<p>Perhaps no other one thing influences the
movement of stock prices so much, in a large
way, as money conditions. It is impossible
to have a big bull market without plenty of
money. During a bull market nearly all stocks
are bought on margin, which is explained in
<a href="#CHAPTER_XVI">Chapter XVI</a>. This makes it necessary for
brokers to borrow large sums of money.
When money is tight, it is impossible to get
enough to carry on a large movement in
stocks.</p>

<p>You will see, therefore, that the Federal
Reserve Bank has it in its power to regulate
the stock market to some extent. In 1919
speculation was carried very much further
than it should have been, but undoubtedly
it would have been much worse had the
Federal Reserve Bank not raised interest
rates and urged member banks to withdraw
money from Wall Street. While there was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
considerable criticism of that action, it certainly
was a good thing for the entire
country.</p>

<p>In a period of depression, the banks accumulate
money, and there always is an
abundance of money at the beginning of a
bull market. During a period of prosperity
the banks' reserves decrease and their loans
increase. When you see these reserves go
down to a very low point, it is usually time
for you to sell your stocks.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIII.<br />
MINOR MOVEMENTS IN PRICES</h2>

<p>Within the major movements of stock
prices, there always are several minor movements,
which are caused by various influences.
One of the important causes is the
technical condition of the market. Another
cause might be called a psychological one.
When stocks are moving up steadily in a
bull market, people closely connected with
the market expect a reaction and watch for
it. The newspapers predict it. Consequently,
there is sufficient let-up in buying to allow
the pressure of selling by the bears to bring
it about. However, the desire to buy during
reactions is so general, many people rush in
to buy and this buying, in addition to the
covering by the shorts, puts the market up
again; and if conditions are favorable for a
bull market, prices will go up much higher
than they were before.</p>

<p>In like manner, we have rallies in bear
markets. Of course the professional bears
sell during these rallies, with the expectation
of buying later at a cheaper price.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span></p>

<p>These minor price changes mean more to
the majority of traders than the major movements.
The major movements are so slow
that people get out of patience, and yet those
who are guided only by the major movements
are operating on a much safer basis. We
believe that a greater amount of money can
be made, with a minimum risk, by being
guided principally by the major movements,
while taking advantage of the minor movements
in a minor way. However, stocks do
not move uniformly and there frequently is
an opportunity to buy some particular stock
at a bargain when nearly all stocks are selling
too high. We try to pick out these
opportunities for our clients.</p>

<p>Reports of earnings by various companies
influence stock prices, as does also the paying
of extra dividends or the passing up of
dividends. A peculiar psychological influence
is noticed when a company declares an extra
dividend. The price of the stock usually goes
up, while as a matter of fact the intrinsic
value of the stock is decreased by the amount
of this dividend; and sometimes it is advisable
to sell a stock shortly after an advance
in its dividend rate.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span></p>
<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XIV" id="CHAPTER_XIV"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br />
TECHNICAL CONDITIONS</h2>

<p>Technical conditions refer to the conditions
that usually affect the supply and demand,
such as short interests, floating supply,
and stop loss orders.</p>

<p>It is sometimes said that supply and demand
must be equal or else there could not
be any sales, but that is not so. There are
always some people who are willing to sell
at some price above the market who will not
sell at the market; and when the demand for
stock is greater than the supply, it goes up
until it is supplied by some of these people
who are holding it at a higher price.</p>

<p>It works the same way when the supply
is greater than the demand. There are always
some people who will buy at some price
below the market. Therefore, when the supply
is greater than the demand prices must
go down.</p>

<p>A stock may have an intrinsic value of
$100 a share and yet be selling at $50 a
share, and it can never sell higher than $50<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
until all stock that is offered at that price
is bought.</p>

<p>However, you should keep this in mind: if
the real value is $100 a share, sooner or later
the market price will approach that figure.
That is why we so strongly urge our clients
to buy stocks that have actual values,
or at least prospective values far greater
than their market prices, and either to buy
them outright or margin them very heavily,
and then hold them until the prices do go up.</p>

<p>Of course, when one finds that a mistake
has been made, the sooner one sells and takes
a loss the better.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XV.<br />
MANIPULATIONS</h2>

<p>Stock prices are influenced largely by manipulation.
Years ago when the volume of
trading on the New York Stock Exchange
was small compared with what it is today,
it was possible to influence the entire market
by manipulation, but it would be very difficult
to do that today. It is only certain
stocks that are manipulated; but if conditions
are favorable, many other stocks may
be influenced by them.</p>

<p>There are different kinds of manipulation.
One is for the insiders of a company to give
out unfavorable news about their company
if they want the price of the stock to go
down, so that they can buy it in; or to give
out very favorable news if they want the
price to go up, so that they can sell out.
This method is not practiced now to the extent
that it was years ago. Public opinion
is strongly opposed to it, and we believe
business men are acquiring a higher standard
of business ethics. Methods of this kind
are legal but they are morally reprehensible.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>Another method of manipulation is the
forming of pools to buy in the stock of a
company and force it up. If the market
price of a stock is far below its real
value, we believe it is justifiable for a pool
to force it up, but the ordinary pool is merely
a scheme to rob the public.</p>

<p>There are four periods to the operation
of such pools. First is the period of accumulation.
A number of large holders of stock
in a certain company will pool their stock,
all agreeing not to sell except from the pool,
in which all benefit proportionately. Then
they give out bad news about the company.
That is very easy to do, because financial
writers usually accept the news that is given
to them without much investigation, especially
writers on daily papers, because they
have not the time to investigate. Their copy
must be ready in a few hours after they get
the information. See <a href="#CHAPTER_XXV">Chapter XXV.</a> on
"Market Information" for fuller explanation
of the reason why financial news usually is
misleading. The manipulators of stock prices
can have financial news "made to order."</p>

<p>When the general public reads this news
and sees the stock going down, many of them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
get discouraged and sell. It is just the time
they should not sell, but it is a well known
fact that the majority of people do in the
stock market just what they should not do.
The more they sell the more the price goes
down, and the pool operators accumulate the
stock.</p>

<p>Having secured all the stock they want,
they give out good news and continue to buy
the stock until it starts to go up. The public
reads this favorable news, and seeing the
stock go up, will go into the market and buy,
which puts it up higher. All the time financial
writers are supplying good news about
the stock and the public buys it. After they
have sold all of it, the public may still be
anxious for more, and the pool operators may
go short of the stock. Then they will begin
giving out bad news, so that they can buy
in stock at a lower price to cover their short
interests.</p>

<p>After that they have very little interest
in the market. If it is declining too fast,
they may support it occasionally by buying
some stock and giving out some favorable
news. That will make the market rally and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
they will sell out the newly acquired stock
near the top of the rally.</p>

<p>Manipulations of this kind appear to be
going on nearly all the time, and there does
not seem to be any limit to the number of
suckers who fall for them. But then, one
can't blame the public when you realize how
thoroughly unreliable is most of the market
information given to them.</p>

<p>Still another kind of manipulation is "one-man"
manipulation, where one man controls
companies, which are known as "one-man"
companies. Usually the directors of these
companies are friends or employees of his,
and in many instances he has their resignations
in his possession, so that they must do
whatever he wants them to do. Owing to
the strict rules of the New York Stock Exchange,
it is rather difficult for such manipulations
to be carried on there. But there
have been many of them on the New York
Curb. When the Curb was operating on the
street and was not under very much control,
manipulations of this kind were very
frequent.</p>

<p>As an example, suppose a man of this kind
has a mining company. When he wants the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
stock to go up, he sends the stockholders a
great deal of information about the work at
the mine, and perhaps sends them a telegram
when a new vein of rich ore is found. The
stockholders rush in to buy more stock, and
that puts the price up. Then he unloads
stock on them to the extent that they will
buy it.</p>

<p>In a day or two, the stock may drop back
to less than one half of what it was selling
at. If this "one-man" manipulator wants to
buy any stock, he will give out a little unfavorable
news, and he can get stock at his
own price.</p>

<p>After that the news is good or bad according
to whether the manipulator wants to buy
or sell, but as a rule he has an abundance of
stock that he wants to sell, and is continually
giving out good news.</p>

<p>A few years ago there was a man operating
in New York who promoted several companies
and manipulated them in a large way.
He is out of business now, but the same thing
is still done in a smaller way.</p>

<p>It is our opinion that more money is lost
by the public in manipulated stocks than
in promotion stocks, and we read a great<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
deal about the enormous losses in them. Promotions
that are failures may be perfectly
legitimate and conducted in the utmost good
faith, but manipulations are nearly always
for the purpose of swindling the public. However,
the lure of them is so great many
people cannot withstand the temptations of
them even after they have been "trimmed"
several times.</p>

MARGINAL TRADING</h2>

<p>Most people who trade in stocks buy on
margin. The ordinary minimum margin is
about 20% of the purchase price, because
banks usually lend about 80% of the market
value of stocks.</p>

<p>If you put up 20% of the purchase price
of your stocks with your broker, he has to
pay the other 80%, but he can do that by
borrowing that amount from his bank, and
putting up the stock as security. In this
way brokers are able to handle all the margin
business that comes to them, as long as
money can be borrowed. Of course, there
are some stocks that are not accepted by
banks as collateral for loans, and you should
not expect your broker to sell such stocks
on margin. In fact, if he offers to do so, it
looks as though he were running a bucket
shop. See <a href="#CHAPTER_XVIII">Chapter XVIII</a>.</p>

<p>Many people think that buying stocks on
margin is gambling and that people should
not do it for that reason, but buying on margin
is done in all lines of business, although it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
may not be known under that name. If you
bought stock outright, but borrowed 80% of
the purchase price from your banker to complete
your payment for it and put up the
stock with him as security, you would be
buying on margin just the same.</p>

<p>In like manner, if you bought a home and
paid 20% with money you had and borrowed
the other 80% of the purchase price, you
would be buying a home on margin. The
principal difference is that when you buy
from a broker on margin, one of the conditions
of his contract is that he has the right
to sell your stock provided the market price
drops down to the amount that you owe on
the stock, whereas if you borrow money on
a home, it is usually for a certain specified
time and the lender cannot sell you out until
that time expires. However, in principle,
there is very little difference between the
two transactions.</p>

<p>Most margin traders do not put up sufficient
margin. If you put up only the minimum
margin, your broker has the right to
call on you for more margin if the price of
the stock declines at all. Unless you are
fully prepared at all times to put up an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
additional margin when called upon, you
should make smaller purchases and put up
a heavy margin when you buy. The amount
of margin depends upon the transaction, but
we advise from 30% to 50%, and at times
we advise not less than 50% margin on any
purchase. In fact there are times when
we advise not to buy stocks on margin at
all.</p>

<p>Those who wish to be entirely free from
worry should buy stocks when the prices
are very low, pay for them in full, get their
certificates, and put them away in a safe
deposit box. However, when stocks are low
the risk in buying on a liberal margin is
very small, and the possibilities of profit are
so much greater, we do not see any objection
to taking advantage of this method of
trading.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII"></a>CHAPTER XVII.<br />
SHORT SELLING</h2>

<p>By short selling, we mean selling a stock
that you do not possess, with the intention
of buying it later. Short selling in general
business is very common, and we think nothing
of it. Manufacturers frequently sell
goods that are not yet made, to be delivered
at some future time. Selling stocks short
is a similar transaction, except that in a majority
of cases delivery of the stock must
be made immediately.</p>

<p>However, your broker can attend to that
by borrowing the stock. As explained in the
preceding chapter, when the market is active
most of the trading is done on margin. Your
broker buys a stock for you, but as he has
to pay for it in full, it is customary for him
to take it to his bank and borrow money on it.
A bank usually lends about 80% of the market
value, but if some other broker wants to
borrow this stock, he will lend the full value
of it. If that particular stock is very scarce
and hard to get, the lender of the stock may<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
get the use of the money without any interest.</p>

<p>Therefore, there is an advantage to the
broker in lending stock, and for that reason
it is nearly always possible for a broker to
arrange delivery of stock for you if you
wish to sell short. When you instruct him
later on to buy the stock for you, he will do
so and deliver it to the broker from whom he
borrowed it, who will return the money he
received for it.</p>

<p>When you sell stock short and the price
goes up, you will have to pay a higher price
for it. Therefore, to protect himself against
the possibility of losing, your broker demands
a payment from you just the same as you
pay margin when you buy stock.</p>

<p>Short selling is something that we do not
recommend very much to our clients. We
think it is not advisable to do any short selling
as long as there are good opportunities
to make money by buying; but when all bargains
disappear, as they do sometimes, you
must either sell short or else keep out of the
market entirely. At such times, there may
be many opportunities to make money by
short selling, and we do not consider that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
there is any reason why our clients should
not take advantage of them.</p>

<p>Of course, great care must be exercised
in selling stocks short. You might sell a
stock short because you know the market
price is 100% greater than its real value,
but it is possible for manipulators to force it
up a great deal higher; and if you are not
able to put up sufficient money with your
broker to protect him, he will buy at a high
price and you will lose the money you have
put up with him. In some instances, stocks
are cornered and the short interests are
forced to buy the stocks at prices that represent
enormous losses.</p>

<p>It is a common thing to read about the
short interests in certain stocks. All stocks
that are sold short must be bought sooner or
later, and when that buying takes place, it
may affect the market very much. Therefore,
if it is known that there is a big short
interest in a certain stock, we should expect
the stock to sell at a higher price; but sometimes
the short interests break the market
and force the price down, especially when
general conditions are in their favor.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVIII" id="CHAPTER_XVIII"></a>CHAPTER XVIII.<br />
BUCKET SHOPS</h2>

<p>There has been so much publicity given
to bucket shops, nearly everybody is familiar
with the term. A broker runs a bucket shop
when he sells stock to his clients on margin
and either never buys the stock for their accounts,
or else sells it immediately after buying
it. The bucket shop simply gets your
money on the supposition that you are more
likely to be wrong than to be right. Of
course, if you take the bucket shop's advice
you surely are likely to be wrong. Bucket
shops get their clients into the very speculative
stocks, where there is likely to be a
great deal of fluctuation in the price of the
stocks, which gives them frequent opportunities
to sell out their clients.</p>

<p>When the market is going down or when
there are many movements up and down in
the price of stocks, the bucket shops make
money rapidly, but occasionally there is a
long period when the market is working
against the bucket shops, and unless they
have a great deal of money they must fail.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>In August, 1921, Stock Exchange stocks
started to go up. The upward movement
was very slow but it was continual. Up to
the time of this writing, there has not been
a three-point reaction, except in a few stocks,
in all of that time. Without a fluctuating
market, the bucket shop has no chance to
clean out its customers. As a consequence,
the bucket shops began to fail in the early
part of 1922, and up to the present writing
(April, 1922) there have been more than fifty
of these failures. However, it is not likely
that all the bucket shops will be put out of
business. The more successful ones are
likely to "weather the storm."</p>

<p>Many laws have been enacted against bucket
shops, and we believe some way will be
found to get rid of them at some future time;
but we do not expect that to happen soon,
and we warn our readers not to get into their
hands, because if they do not get your money
away from you one way they are likely to
get it some other way. The man who runs
a bucket shop usually has no conscience, and
it certainly is an unfortunate thing for anyone
to get mixed up with such a man.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XIX.<br />
CHOOSING A BROKER</h2>

<p>It is very important that you choose a
good broker. No matter how careful you are,
it is possible to make a mistake. However,
if you choose a broker who is a member of
the New York Stock Exchange, you have
eliminated a very large percentage of your
chances of getting a wrong broker.</p>

<p>Occasionally a member of the Stock Exchange
fails and once in a while one is suspended
for running a bucket shop or being
connected with one, but these instances are
very rare compared with the number of brokers
who get into trouble who are not members
of the New York Stock Exchange. The
rules and regulations of the Stock Exchange
protect you to a great extent.</p>

<p>When you buy stock on margin, you leave
your money in the hands of a broker, and
you should know that he is responsible. No
matter who your broker is, you should get a
report on him. If you are a subscriber to
Bradstreet's or Dun's Agencies, get a report
from them. If you are not a subscriber to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
any mercantile agency, you perhaps have a
friend who can get a report for you, or your
bank may get one for you. Banks make a
practice of getting reports of this kind for
their clients. When asked to do so, we send
our clients the names of brokers who are
members of the New York Stock Exchange,
but we prefer not to recommend any broker.
Of course, we cannot guarantee that a broker
is all right. We simply use our best judgment,
but, as we said before, you eliminate
a large percentage of your chances of going
wrong when you trade with a broker who
is a member of the New York Stock Exchange.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XX.<br />
PUTS AND CALLS</h2>

<p>A "put" is a negotiable contract giving the
holder the privilege to sell a specified number
of shares of a certain stock to the maker
at a fixed price, within a specified time. A
"call" is the exact reverse. It is a negotiable
contract giving the holder the privilege
to buy a specified number of shares of a certain
stock from the maker at a fixed price,
within a specified time. The price fixed in
a put or call is set away from the market
price a certain number of points, depending
upon the stock and the condition of the market.
When the market is steady and not
fluctuating, the price fixed is frequently only
two points away, but in a more active market
it is considerably more.</p>

<p>For instance, at the present time, U. S.
Steel is selling at about 95, and you can buy
a call on it at 97 or a put at 93. That is by
paying a certain amount, which at present is
$137.50, you can have the privilege of buying
100 shares of U. S. Steel at 97, within
thirty days of the date of the purchase of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
your call. If Steel should go up to 101 you
could have your broker buy it at 97 and sell
it at the market, and you would make a
profit of four points, less the cost of your
call and commissions.</p>

<p>As a method of operating in the stock
market, we do not recommend the buying of
puts and calls. Professional speculators may
be able to use them to advantage sometimes,
but for the outsider, who is not in close touch
with the market, there is nothing about them
to recommend.</p>

<p>Here is one point: the people who sell puts
and calls fix the terms. If the market is
irregular, they will set the point of buying
or selling far away from the market price.
These people are shrewd traders and they
make the terms in their own favor. It is
generally said that nearly all the buyers of
puts and calls lose, and that is our opinion.
Therefore, we advise you to leave them alone.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXI.<br />
STOP LOSS ORDERS</h2>

<p>A "stop-loss" is an order to your broker
to sell you out if the market sells down a
certain number of points. Many speculators
place stop loss orders only two points from
the market price. The idea is that when the
market starts to go down it is likely to continue
going down, and by taking a two-point
loss you may save a much greater loss. It
also can be applied to a short sale, when you
give your broker instructions to buy in the
stock for you if it goes up a certain number
of points.</p>

<p>We read so much in the financial news
about stop-loss orders or merely stop orders,
which is the same thing, the average reader
is likely to get the idea that it is something
he must use for his own protection, but it
is our opinion that it is something that should
be used very seldom by those who trade along
the broad lines recommended by us. If your
purchases were made in stocks that were
very cheap, you should continue to hold them
in case of a reaction. If you bought them<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
outright or on a substantial margin, you are
not in danger, and you should look upon your
loss merely as a paper loss. In the great
majority of cases, you will be a great deal
better off to hold on to your stocks than you
would be if you had a stop-loss order.</p>

<p>A large number of stop-loss orders is a
good thing for the short interests. Let us
take U. S. Steel again, as an example. Suppose
it is selling at 94 and it is believed
that there are a large number of stop-loss
orders at 92. The short interests may sell
the stock heavily and force it down to 92.
Then the brokers with stop-loss orders would
begin to sell; that would force the price down
still lower, and the short interests could buy
in to cover at this lower price.</p>

<p>Therefore, we believe that stop-loss orders
are a bad thing and, as a rule, do not recommend
them.</p>

<p>There is one instance where a stop-loss
order can be used to advantage, and that is
near the top of a bull market. It is impossible
to tell when the market has reached the
top. If you sell out too soon, you may lose
a profit of several points. Of course, it is
better to do that than to take a chance of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
a large loss. In that case, you might instruct
your broker to place a stop-loss order at two
or more points below the market, and keep
moving it up as the market price moves up.
Then when the reaction does come, he will
sell you out and prevent you from losing a
large part of your profit. That is about the
only instance where we recommend a stop-loss
order, but we do recommend it to our
clients sometimes, although seldom.</p>

<p>If the stock you own is selling at more
than 100 we would suggest that you make
the stop loss order at least three points from
the market, but for stocks selling below 100,
a two-point stop-loss order might be used.
However, the number of points should be
decided upon in each particular case. In the
special instructions to our clients, we tell
them when we think they can use a stop-loss
order to advantage.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXII.<br />
THE DESIRE TO SPECULATE</h2>

<p>It is said that the desire to speculate is
very strong in the American people. That
is why our country has made greater progress
than any other country in the world, because
progress is the result of speculation. We
are not referring merely to stock speculations,
but to the word in its broadest sense.
Every new undertaking is a speculation.</p>

<p>An inventor speculates on what he is going
to invent. Often such speculations result in
losses, because many inventors, or would-be-inventors,
never accomplish very much. They
spend their money, time, and efforts, and
probably live years in poverty, and then if
the invention is not profitable, they are heavy
losers. Many inventors spend the best years
of their lives in poverty and never succeed.
We hear a great deal about some of those
who do succeed, but very little about those
who fail&mdash;those whose speculations were unsuccessful&mdash;except
when somebody accuses
them of being crooks because they solicited<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
money for the promotion of their inventions
and did not succeed.</p>

<p>It is the same thing with every new business.
It is purely a speculation. It is a common
saying that 95% of commercial undertakings
fail. We do not know that that
statement is correct, but there is no question
but that the number of failures is very great,
which shows the great risk in going into a
new undertaking. It is far greater than the
risk involved in stock speculating when it is
done in accordance with the advice given in
this book.</p>

<p>Yet, there would be no progress without
speculating of this kind. If those entering
a new business would make a careful study
of the venture before entering it, and would
exercise greater care and judgment in conducting
it, the number of failures would be
very much less. The same thing is true of
stock speculating. The failures in stock speculating
are caused mainly by ignorance and
greediness. Many people who would be satisfied
with a fair return on their money in a
business enterprise, think they ought to make
a 100% profit in a few weeks in stock
speculation.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span></p>

<p>There is something about stock speculation
that appeals to the greediness and pure
gambling instincts of people. In the chapter
on Manipulation, we have told you how stock
prices are put up and down. Some outsider
accidentally buys one of these stocks just
before the price starts up. In thirty days
he has made several hundred per cent profit.
He does not realize that it was purely accidental
as far as he was concerned, and he
tries to do the same thing again, and loses
all of his profits and probably all of his capital
as well.</p>

<p>A stock gambler (we use the word "gambler"
to refer to a man who operates ignorantly)
is watching a large number of extremely
speculative stocks and suddenly
notices one that takes a big jump in price.
Then he says to himself, "If I only had
bought that stock on a ten-point margin, I
would have made several hundred per cent
profit." He picks out another stock that
some one tells him is going to do equally
as well. He buys as much of it as he can and
puts up all the money he has as a margin,
but the price doesn't go up. Perhaps the
price goes down and he loses his margin; but,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
it may remain almost stationary for a long
period, sometimes for a year or more, and
during all of this time, this man is worrying
for fear he will lose his money. If he does
not lose his money, it is tied up for a long
time where he cannot use it to take advantage
of real opportunities that come his way.</p>

<p>It does not pay to take big risks. That is
true in stock speculating the same as in any
other undertaking. Most speculators are
keeping their minds all the time on the possibilities
of profit and not thinking about the
possibilities of losing.</p>

<p>If you want to be successful in stock speculating,
there is one thing you must learn
to do, and that is never to think about the
big profits you might have made if you had
bought such and such a stock, because the
probabilities are you could not have afforded
to take the necessary risk in buying that
stock.</p>

<p>Of course, after it is all over, it may look
to you as though the buying of that stock
was a sure thing, but the buying of such
stocks is never a sure thing. The risk always
exists. There is an old saying, and we believe
a very true one, that a man who speculates<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
with the idea of getting rich quickly loses all
his money quickly, but that the man who
speculates with the idea of making a fair
return on his money usually gets rich.</p>

<p>In our advice to our clients, we seldom
recommend highly speculative stocks, because
we consider the avoidance of loss more
important than the making of profits. You
may object to that statement, because you
speculate to make profits, and not for the
purpose of avoiding losses. Nevertheless, if
you are careful in keeping your losses down
to a minimum, your profits are likely to be
very liberal. Any trader who trades for any
great length of time is likely to make large
profits sometimes, and yet the majority of
them have greater losses than profits. It is
said that more than 80% of all margin traders
lose; but we do not consider that an argument
against trading on margin, because
these losses are mostly due to ignorance,
greediness, and the taking of too great
chances.</p>

<p>Do not suppress your desire to speculate.
All progress would stop if people did not
speculate. But do not speculate in stocks
nor in anything else without any knowledge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of what you are doing, and try to use as
much good judgment and care as possible in
all of your transactions. If you do not know
what to do, get advice from someone who is
supposed to know and who is not interested
in having you buy or sell. Stock speculating
with safety is possible for those who make
the effort to be guided by correct principles.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.<br />
TWO KINDS OF TRADERS</h2>

<p>There are two kinds of stock traders. One
kind nearly always makes a profit, and the
other wins sometimes and loses other times,
but eventually loses all if he does not change
his methods. The first kind buys stocks on
liberal margin or outright and is not worried
when the market goes against him, because
he has good reasons for believing that prices
eventually will go up. If he does have to
take a loss occasionally, it is likely to be
small compared with his profits. The second
kind wants to make a big profit quickly, and
he buys stocks that he thinks are going to
make big gains in the near future, but his
selections are not based upon good judgment.</p>

<p>We might designate these two traders as
the careful trader and the reckless trader.</p>

<p>The careful trader tries to get good advice
on the markets and the values of stocks. If
the advice appears to him to be conservative,
he is guided by it; but if the reckless trader
gets advice on stocks, he is not guided by it
if it is of a conservative nature. If he does<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
take advice, it is likely to be from one of
those unreliable market tipsters who is very
emphatic in his statements about what the
market is going to do. The reckless trader
lets his greed and desire for large and quick
profits influence his judgment.</p>

<p>Once in a while one of these reckless traders
realizes that he has made a great mistake,
and he wants to change his attitude.
Usually he is holding several stocks that
show a big loss and he does not know what
to do with them. He reasons that they are
selling so low now they surely will sell higher
some time. Perhaps his reasoning is good
and perhaps it is not. The stocks may have
no chance of going up for a very long time,
if at all, but even though they have a good
chance to go up later, it is better for him to
sell them now if he can put the money derived
from the sale into something else that has a
better chance to make a profit.</p>

<p>Our advice is never to hesitate to sell and
take a loss if you can put the proceeds
from the sale into something better rather
than leave it in the stock in which it is now.
It is not so much a question whether or not
the stock you are holding will go up, as it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
is whether or not you would buy that particular
stock if you were just coming into
the market to make a purchase. Of course
there is a loss of commissions when you sell
a stock and buy something else, and for that
reason we sometimes recommend holding a
stock when we would not recommend
buying it.</p>

<p>If you have been a reckless trader in the
past, the only thing for you to do is to
change your methods and try to become a
careful trader. It is much better to go to
the extreme in carefulness and be satisfied
with very small profits than to take great
risks.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV.<br />
POSSIBILITIES OF PROFIT</h2>

<p>What are the possibilities of profit in stock
speculation? That question is frequently
asked but it is difficult to answer. James R.
Keene is quoted as having said: "Many men
come to Wall Street to get rich; they always
go broke. Others come to Wall Street to operate
intelligently for fair returns; they usually
get rich."</p>

<p>While it is true that nearly all stock traders
who try to make unusually large profits
in a very short time in stock trading lose, yet
unusual profits can be made if you exercise
good judgment and have patience.</p>

<p>Roger W. Babson, in his book entitled,
"Business Barometers," speaks of the possibilities
of profit in language that would be
considered greatly exaggerated if used by a
promoter, and yet he is extremely conservative
in his advice to traders. He advises
never to buy on margin, never to sell short,
and staying out of the market entirely,
neither buying or selling, for a great part
of the time. Here is a quotation from his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
book, which follows a detailed statement of
an investment of $2,500 over a period of fifty
years:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"The preceding example shows that $2,500 conservatively
invested in a few standard stocks about
fifty years ago would today amount to over
$1,000,000. These are not only strictly investment
stocks, but are also stocks which have fluctuated
comparatively little in price. This, moreover was
possible by giving orders to buy or sell only once
in every three or four years.</p>

<p>"If other stocks which were not dividend payers
and which have shown greater fluctuations were
purchased, and advantage had been taken of the
intermediate fluctuations, the $2,500 would have
amounted to much larger figures. By intermediate
movements is not meant the weekly movements
which the ordinary professional operator notes, but
the broader movements extending over many months
and possibly a year or more. Nevertheless, these
broader intermediate movements should not be
noticed by a conservative investor, as it is possible
to correctly diagnose only the movements extending
over longer periods. Many brokers believe that it
is possible to discern also these intermediate movements
of six or eight months; and if so, the following
results would have been possible.</p></div>

<div class="bq2"><p>"$5,000 invested in 'St. Paul' in 1870 would
amount to over $10,000,000 today.</p>

<p>"$5,000 invested in 'Union Pacific' in 1870
would amount to over $15,000,000 today.</p>

<p>"$5,000 invested in 'Central of New Jersey'
would amount to over $30,000,000 today.</p>

<p>"$5,000 invested in 'Northern Pacific' would
amount to over $50,000,000 today.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"These figures are not based on the supposition
that the investor was selling at the top of every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
rise or buying at the bottom of every decline, but
that the transactions were made at average 'high'
and average 'low' prices based upon the study of
technical conditions."</p></div>

<p>If such large profits can be made by following
Babson's advice, of course larger
profits can be made by buying on conservative
margin and by selling short when all
the conditions are in favor of it.</p>

<p>While there are possibilities of making
extremely large profits without taking great
risks, by those who are patient and exercise
good judgment, one should be satisfied with
a small profit, if it is the result of great care,
in an effort to eliminate risk. Of course, you
can afford to take a much greater risk with
a small part of your speculative fund than
you can with all of it. The less money you
have with which to speculate, the more careful
you should be. Some people cannot afford
to speculate at all. They should invest their
funds in good, safe investments, but this
book is written for speculators.</p>

<p>Careful stock speculation carried on regularly
over a period of years, we believe brings
larger returns than almost anything else, and
in the next chapter we tell you something
about where to get information to guide you.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV"></a>CHAPTER XXV.<br />
MARKET INFORMATION</h2>

<p>Where do you get your market information?
Perhaps most people get it from the
daily papers. When you look over the financial
news of one of the leading metropolitan papers
and see how much there is of it, you can
get some idea of the enormous volume of
work necessary to get this matter ready for
the press in a few hours. There is no time to
confirm reports. It is necessary that many
of the articles be written from pure imagination,
based on rumors.</p>

<p>Weekly and monthly periodicals can be
more accurate in their information, but even
they are not always dependable. Much of
the financial news published comes from
agencies that are not reliable. Read what
Henry Clews says about them:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Principally among these caterers are the financial
news agencies and the morning Wall Street news
sheet, both specially devoted to the speculative interests
that centre at the Stock Exchange. The object of
these agencies is a useful one; but the public have a
right to expect that when they subscribe for information
upon which immense transactions may be undertaken,
the utmost caution, scrutiny and fidelity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
should be exercised in the procurement and publication
of the news. Anything that falls short of this
is something worse than bad service and bad faith
with subscribers; it is dishonest and mischievous.
And yet it cannot be denied that much of the so-called
news that reaches the public through these
instrumentalities must come under this condemnation.
The 'points,' the 'puffs,' the alarms and the canards,
put out expressly to deceive and mislead, find a wide
circulation through these mediums, with an ease
which admits of no possible justification. How far
these lapses are due to the haste inseparable from the
compilation of news of such a character, how far to
a lack of proper sifting and caution, how far to less
culpable reasons I do not pretend to decide; but
this will be admitted by every observer, that the
circulation of pseudo news is the frequent cause
of incalculable losses. Nor is it alone in the matter
of circulating false information that these news venders
are at fault. The habit of retailing 'points'
in the interest of cliques, the volunteering of advice
as to what people should buy and what they should
sell, the strong speculative bias that runs through
their editorial opinions, these things appear to most
people a revolting abuse of the true functions of
journalism."</p></div>

<p>Of course, every trader gets market letters
from one or more brokers. These are many
and varied in character. Some of them are
prepared with great care and give reliable
information, but you must remember that
a broker's market letter is published for the
purpose of getting business, and business is
created only by the customers' trading.
Therefore it is to the broker's interest to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
have his customers make many trades instead
of a few trades. In his book "Business
Barometers," Roger W. Babson reproduces a
letter written to him by the Manager of the
Customers' Room of a Stock Exchange
House. We consider this letter so important
to all traders, we are taking the liberty to
reproduce it here:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Hearing on every hand about the fortunes made
in Wall Street, I decided, upon being graduated from
college, to devote myself to finance. With this end
in view, I secured a position with a first-class New
York Stock Exchange House, finally becoming the
'handshaker' for the firm; that is, 'manager' of the
customers' room. So I had an exceptional opportunity
to size up the stock business. The chief
duties of the manager are to meet customers when
they visit the office, tell them how the market is
acting, the latest news from the news-tickers and
the gossip of the Street. But the real duties are
to get business for the house. Once a most peculiar
man came to the office. He was about forty-five
years of age, dressed in a faded cutaway coat, high-water
trousers, and an East Side low-crown derby
hat. In a high squeaky voice he said that he knew
our Milwaukee House and would like to open an account.
Of course, we were all smiles, for here was
a new 'customer.'</p>

<p>"One day while in Boston he called us up on the
long-distance telephone to make an inquiry about
the grain market. One of my assistants, desiring to
get a commission out of him, said 'We hear that
Southern Pacific is going up; you had better get
aboard.' He said 'All right; buy me a hundred at
the market.' The stock was bought, but he never
saw daylight on his purchase, for the market declined<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
steadily afterward and by the time he got
back from Boston it showed a heavy loss. The man
who advised its purchase had no special knowledge
about the stock, but simply took a chance, knowing
that the market had only two ways to go, and it
might go up, in which case, besides making twenty-five
dollars in commissions for the house, he would
be patted on the back for his good judgment. If the
market went down, as it did, he would still make
twenty-five dollars.</p>

<p>"I venture to say that 99% of the speculations
on the New York Stock Exchange are based on
such so-called 'tips'. The manager has got to get
the business to keep his position and salary, and this
can only be done by 'touting' people into the market.
So he draws on the 'dope' sheets of the professional
tipsters and his own feelings, and gives positive
information to the bleating lamb that the Standard
Oil is putting up St. Paul, or that certain influential
bankers are 'bulling' Union Pacific. The lamb buys
the stock, the broker gets the commission, and then
the lamb worries his heart out as he sees his one-thousand-dollar
margin jumping around in value.
Now it has increased to eleven hundred dollars, then
declined to nine hundred and fifty dollars, then nine
hundred dollars, eight hundred dollars, then back to
eight hundred and fifty dollars and then it takes the
'toboggan' to three hundred dollars upon which the
broker calls for margins, and sells the customer out
if they are not forthcoming, the whole speculation
being based on the manager's 'feeling' that stocks
ought to go up.</p>

<p>"Men of affairs who will not play poker at home,
and are shocked at the mention of faro and roulette,
which any old-timer will tell you are easier to beat
than the stock market, think they are using business
judgment when they try to make money on stock
market 'tips'. Anyone with common sense can see
that a 10% margin has no more chance in an active
market than a brush dam in a Johnstown flood. One<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
of the causes for this kind of speculating on a margin
is that a broker's commission is only 12<span class="abv">1</span>&#8260;<span class="blw">2</span> cents
per share and it does not pay to do small-lot business.
The one-thousand-dollar margin would only
buy ten shares outright and net the broker but $1.25
for buying and $1.25 for selling, whereas that same
amount as margin on one hundred shares yields the
broker $12.50 each way besides interest on the balance,
the net result being that for any given amount
of money a speculator on 10% margin multiplies his
profits by ten and his losses by ten over those that
would occur were he to buy the stock outright and
take it home. The broker on his side multiplies his
commission by ten over what he would receive were
he to do an investment business."</p></div>

<p>From the above letter you get an idea of
the attitude of an employee of the average
broker's office. He would not be considered
loyal to his employer if he had a different attitude.
When an attitude like this influences
the broker's market letters, they are not
reliable.</p>

<p>You may ask whether there is any reliable
information about the market. Yes, there
is. There are several large organizations
that make a study of fundamental statistics
and statistics of different companies and give
information to their subscribers based upon
this knowledge. We believe that is the only
kind of information that is worth very much
to a trader, except the statistical information&mdash;the
number of shares sold and the prices at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
which they are sold&mdash;he gets from his daily
or weekly papers. Some of the principal organizations
of this kind are as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p><i>Standard Statistics Company, Inc.<br />
Babson's Statistical Organization.<br />
The Brookmire Economic Service.<br />
Harvard Economic Service.<br />
Poor's Investment Service.<br />
Moody's Investors Service.<br />
Richard D. Wyckoff Analytical Staff.</i></p></div>

<p>The above are the principal organizations
of this kind. Subscriptions to their service
cost from $85 to $1000 a year. In addition
to these there are a few other organizations
besides our own and individuals giving a
somewhat similar service, but we know of
none that gives such a service at as low a
price as ours.</p>

<p>You should not confuse the service given
by the above organizations with that given
by many organizations and individuals who
attempt to tell you what the market is going
to do from day to day. In other words, they
give 'tips' on the market. There are a number
who issue daily market letters of this
kind and charge from $10 to $25 a month
for their service, but it is a line of service
that we do not recommend at all, because we
consider that you would be taking a very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
great risk if you followed advice of that kind.
You might make enormously large profits
occasionally, but you would also have frequent
losses, and when the losses did come
they might be greater than all the previous
profits. We want you to understand that
that kind of advice is entirely different from
what we are recommending.</p>

<hr /><p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>
<h2>CHAPTER XXVI.<br />
SUCCESSFUL SPECULATION</h2>

<p>Success in stock speculation depends upon
a few things that are very simple.</p>

<p>If you know what to buy, when to buy,
and when to sell, and will act in accordance
with that knowledge, your success is assured.
You may think it is impossible to know these
things, but it is not so difficult as it is supposed
to be.</p>

<p>Many people buy stocks at the wrong time,
and most of those who do buy them at the
right time, buy the wrong stocks. Right now
(early in April, 1922) is buying time in the
stock market, and it is possible that this buying
time may continue&mdash;with some interruptions&mdash;for
another year or two, or even
longer.</p>

<p>It is more difficult, however, to tell you
WHAT stocks to buy. First of all, we advise
you against buying stocks that are put
up to high prices by manipulation. Of course,
if you get in one of those stocks right and
get out right, your profits are very large,
but you take a great risk, and those who win<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
once or twice by this method are almost sure
to lose everything sooner or later in an effort
to do the same thing again. Your
chances are not much better than if you
gambled at Monte Carlo. The chances in
buying manipulated stocks are invariably
against the outsider.</p>

<p>There always is so much publicity about
these very active speculative stocks that the
public is attracted towards them. Newspapers
and brokers' market letters give altogether
too much space to them. Such
stocks sell far too high, and when the break
comes, it brings ruinous losses to many
people.</p>

<p>On the other hand, by following a conservative
course, you really have a chance to
make large profits with a minimum risk. We
are giving below sixteen stocks that we recommended
in our Advisory Letter of February
14th, 1922, with the approximate prices
of them then and the approximate prices on
March 31st.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> In arriving at these prices, we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
took the closing prices on February 13th and
on March 31st, and omitted the fractions.
We recommended only sixteen stocks on that
date, and you will see that every one of them
made substantial gains.</p>

<p>Let us suppose you bought ten shares of
each of these stocks on February 14th. They
would have cost you $10,050. We recommended
30% margin on the first ten, all of
which were dividend payers; and 50% margin
on the last six, because they were more
speculative and would have been more affected<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
by a reaction in the market. To buy
ten shares of each on that margin basis
would have required a little less than $3,500,
but let us suppose you put up $3,500. After
allowing for buying and selling commissions
and interest on the balance of $6,550, but
crediting you with dividends paid, your profit
would be about 32% or at the rate of about
250% per annum.</p>

<p>Of course, we do not claim that by following
the conservative course we advise,
you always will make such large profits, although
you might do just as well as that
if you took advantage of some of the opportunities
so frequently to be found in the market;
but keen discrimination in what you
buy always is necessary. However, let us
suppose you made annual profits of one-fifth
the above amount, or 50%, which is easily
possible without taking the risks that are
usually taken in stock speculating. If you
invested $1000 and made 50% profit per annum,
reinvesting your profit at the same rate
each year for twenty years, you would have
more than THREE MILLION DOLLARS.</p>

<p>When there is a possibility of making such
enormous profits as that by following careful<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
methods, surely there is no argument in
favor of taking the extreme risks that people
do take in buying the highly speculative
stocks, the prices of which are put up for
the purpose of unloading them on the public.
Ten of the stocks we selected in the above
list were dividend payers, and while the other
six were not, they were considered worth
much more than their market prices, and
the list as a whole was conceded by conservative
people as a safe one to buy.</p>

<p>Very frequently we are able to recommend
a list of stocks that we believe will
yield equally large profits, but the stocks you
should buy are not the ones that are the
most active nor the ones that are mentioned
most frequently in the financial news and
brokers' market letters. The stocks that
most people buy are usually the very stocks
that should be left alone. The stocks you
should buy are usually the ones you hear
very little about.</p>

<p>There is only one SAFE way to speculate,
and that is to be guided by a knowledge of
the fundamental conditions of each stock and
also of the industries they represent. There
are several large organizations giving information<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
of this kind, and those who have been
guided by the fundamental statistics issued
by them, almost invariably have made money
in stock speculating. The value of that kind
of service has been thoroughly demonstrated
beyond any question. However, a subscription
for the service of most of these organizations
costs more than the average person
can afford to pay. Usually it is anywhere
from $100 to $1,000 a year.</p>

<p>We are giving a service for the purpose of
guiding our clients to successful speculation
for a fee of only $25 a year, $15 for six
months, or $10 for three months. For this
fee we tell you what stocks to buy, when to
buy, and when to sell. We send you our
recommendations at least twice a month, but
send you additional Advisory Letters and lists
oftener if conditions make it necessary. You
also have the privilege of unlimited personal
correspondence regarding your market problems.
The cost of our Service is very small,
compared with what other reliable organizations
charge.</p>

<p>Our Service is based on the principles expounded
in this book. We try to select
stocks having the greatest possibilities of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
profit with minimum risk, and the sample
of our Service given in this chapter is proof
of our success.</p>
